Thanks for contributing to Resora!

At this point, there is not enough interest to bother writing a real Contributing.md file, so I'll just say "contribute away."

If you wish to run the app on your machine, you will need secret keys. Contact me directly and I will either give you the keys or tell you how to make your own.
